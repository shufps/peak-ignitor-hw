# 🔥 Peak Ignitor  (AI Summary 😁)

**Peak Ignitor** is a compact, high‑power **12 V portable power unit**.
It started with a very simple requirement:

> *“I want to reliably light a cigarette on a freezing mountain peak.”*

…and, as usual, escalated significantly.

## 🧪 Design Philosophy

Peak Ignitor is **not a commercial product**, but a **statement**:

- No fantasy specifications
- No low‑end power‑bank compromises
- No “good enough” thermal guessing

Instead:

- Honest performance
- Clean layout
- Electrical and mechanical design as one system
- Built for **real‑world reliability**

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- High‑current device – not a toy.
- Use only suitable loads.
- Do not modify without understanding protection mechanisms.
- Never operate the battery without the BMS.

---

## 🧠 Why You Can’t Buy This

Because the market offers either:

- tiny USB power banks **or**
- huge car jump‑starter bricks

**Peak Ignitor sits right in between**:
too compact, too powerful, too specialized.

So it was built.
